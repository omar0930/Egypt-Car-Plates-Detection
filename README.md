# Egypt Car Plates Detection ðŸš—

This project is an AI-powered car plate detection system built using **YOLOv7**. It detects and recognizes Egyptian car plates with **high accuracy (0.94 mAP)**. The model was trained using a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **High Accuracy (0.94 mAP)** for plate detection
- **YOLOv7-based model** for real-time performance
- **Custom dataset** from Roboflow for Egyptian plates
- **End-to-end pipeline** (Training, Evaluation, and Deployment)

## ðŸ“Œ Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omar0930/Egypt-Car-Plates-Detection.git
   cd Egypt-Car-Plates-Detection
   ```

## ðŸ›  Future Improvements
- Implement real-time plate recognition
- Optimize the model for mobile and embedded systems
